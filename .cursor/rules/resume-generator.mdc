# Resume Generator

This is a Typst-based resume system using the `toy-cv` template.

## Project Structure
- `resume.typ` - Main template (reference this for structure)
- `config.yaml` - Default configuration
- `data/*.yaml` - All resume content (personal, experience, skills, projects, etc.)
- `job_applications.json` - Tracks all job applications and their resume files
- `resumes/{Company}_{Job Title}.typ` - Custom resumes per job application

## Creating Custom Resumes

### When the user asks to find jobs:
1. Use browser tools to snapshot the job listing page
2. Read `data/skills.yaml` and `data/experience.yaml` to understand the user's profile
3. Match jobs based on skills and experience level
4. Skip entry-level roles if user has significant experience

### For each matching job, create `resumes/{Company}_{Job Title}.typ`:
1. Follow the exact pattern from `resume.typ` - import all data files
2. Use `../data/` paths since resumes are in a subfolder
3. Use inline config (don't create separate config files)
4. Customize only:
   - `main-color` - Use company brand color
   - `custom-tagline` - Tailor to job description keywords
   - `config.sections` - Which sections to include
   - `config.include` - Which entries by ID (check the data files for available IDs)
   - Sidebar interests - Match role context if relevant

### Update `job_applications.json` with:
```json
{
  "company": "...",
  "job_title": "...", 
  "location": "...",
  "salary_range": "...",
  "job_posting_url": "...",
  "resume_file": "resumes/{Company}_{Job Title}.typ",
  "fit_score": "Excellent/Good/Fair - brief reason",
  "status": "pending"
}
```

## Key Principles
- Always reference `resume.typ` for the current template structure
- Check `data/*.yaml` files for available entry IDs before creating resumes
- Keep custom resumes self-contained (no external config dependencies)
- Match the job title in the subtitle to what you're applying for
